# Splendor

The following contains the end product of my coding project taken during my Bachelor degree at Hogeschool Gent. The aim was to build our own virtual version of the popular card game Splendor, together with 3 other students. 

I also want to send a big thanks to [Andy](https://github.com/NDWauters) as his experience and leadership took our project to another level.
