# Splendor

Software development project that 3 other students and me took during the Bachelor degree at Hogeschool Gent. The project is an own build version of the Splendor card game.

I also want to send a big thanks to [Andy](https://github.com/NDWauters) as his experience and leadership took our project to another level.
